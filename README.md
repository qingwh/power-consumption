# power-consumption
To help Smart Home owners with greater understanding and control of their power usage, I created analytics and visualizations of this time series data from different angles in R. I also applied time series linear regression, Holt Winters Simple Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA model to make forecasting for future electric power consumption.

Descriptions of data: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.  This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months). 

Location of data: The data for this project is currently stored on a database in several annual tables (yr_2006, yr_2007, yr_2008, yr_2009, yr_2010). The database is stored by the host which address is data-analytics-2018.cbrosir2cswx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com.
